Title: Wrapper to XCMS to create a consistent R list object or HDF5 file

Description: Create a logical object to store and access LCMS data, either as an
    RDS object or HDF5 file. Conversion creates a rasterized lcms matrix defined by 
    the desired fidelity, allowing (using HDF5 format) access to ms1-'hyperslabs' without
    loading the entire file. Furthermore, this format preserves the ability to collect
    profile data without increasing disk-space, and in many cases is more efficient then 
    centroid data.
